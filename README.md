TODO: Much the same at the others - let's get the standard stuff live first

## TO DO

- Add a yellow overlay when you mouse over a fellow (this is hard, forget it)
- Add Google Analytics
- When we have Fellows, replace the Member Benefits section on the home page with that.
- Link form submissions on Zapier
- Masthead image not viewable on mobile
- Add smooth scrolling
- Hook up Continuous Deployment again
- Fix the incorrect links (mostly icons) that prevents parcel from running atm.
- Add all the parcel steps to package.json so we can use it via yarn first, then makefile
