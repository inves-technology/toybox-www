				YouTube channel, RefilloeLife, focused on addressing the gap in the mainstream media's offering to women who were
				not thirst trapping, fashion blogging and generally living only for the gram.</p>
			<p>After five years of co-hosting Metro FM's highest rated drive show, TouchDown 326, Refiloe left to pursue an
				exciting investment and work opportunity in China. Upon returning to South Africa, she began focussing on
				engendering an urgency among South Africans around how we are shaping our collective future, how our current social
				contracts hobble us, and how future ones could help us to develop.</p>
			<p>Refiloe is currently working on a podcast agency that will among other things focus on creating thoughtful and
